# FORage

FORage is a simple, text-based expedition manager game written in Fortran. 

Story
-----
Climate change, pandemics, and global political instability lead to a series of worldwide conflicts that turned the whole planet into a postapocalyptic wasteland. Only the most resilient and adaptable survived ... that includes pigeons (and Fortran code). You are one of the surviving pigeons of Scotland and responsible to create a better life for your flock. Eventually, you see no other choice but to leave your beloved home, which had been anything but hospitable since the AMOC shut down. You set out to reunite your fellow Scottish pigeons with your comrades on continental Europe. The journey will be long and dangerous, but you are ready to take the risk!

Gameplay
--------
- **Build a team**: All applicants for your pigeon-expedition have a unique set of skills and character traits. Choose a set of eager adventurers and make them your expedition members. You must gather your party before venturing FORth!
- **Lead your expedition**: Decide how you spend the day before making camp. Forage and scout to gain resources, explore points of interest, spend time on recreation to keep up morale, distribute rations, and guard your camp to protect your members and resources from wild animals and bandits.
- **Survive**: Deal with accidents and diseases, prevent a mutiny, and defend your camp against intruders.

Installation
------------
FORage can be installed/compiled with the fortran package manager (fpm).
